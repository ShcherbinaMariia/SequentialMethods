# Sequential Methdos

### Interface

Well, it is quite minimalistic: 
![Example of interface](results/exampleInterface.png)

All you need is to type the formula you want to solve (using characters like `@`, `#` instead of $\forall$, $\exists$)

### Examples of output:

It could be like this:
![Example of output 1](results/example1.png)
Or like this:
![Example of output 2](results/example2.png)

It is not hard to understand what is the result of the above examples. So good luck in learning mathematical logic. Hope this project will help you to understand sequential methods (or Java, depends on your goal).
